:summary: My talk at the Valais/Wallis AI workshop on reproducible research


This is a talk I gave at the Valais/Wallis AI workshop on reproducible
research. The topic of my talk tries to leverage experience in the development
of `Bob`_, a framework for reproducible research and `BEAT`_, a web platform
for the same purpose. I describe how both are connected and our model for
reproducible research in data sciences. Click on `this link`_ to see the talk.
