:summary: I was interviewed for a document in Jornal Nacional, one of the most
          viewed brazilian 20h00 news program.


This short document was aired September, 10th. 2008 as part of the CERN's LHC
start up celebrations. The "Jornal Nacional" is Brazil's nationwide 20h00 news
magazine. I appear by the end of the article, answering one of the
interviewer's question - that was fun!
