  abstract   = "While more accurate and reliable than ever, the trustworthiness of biometric verification systems is compromised by the emergence of spoofing attacks. Responding to this threat, numerous research publications address isolated spoofing detection, resulting in efficient counter-measures for many biometric modes. However, an important, but often overlooked issue regards their engagement into a verification task and how to measure their impact on the verification systems themselves. A novel evaluation framework for verification systems under spoofing attacks, called Expected Performance and Spoofability (EPS) framework, is the major contribution of this paper. Its purpose is to serve for an objective comparison of different verification systems with regards to their verification performance and vulnerability to spoofing, taking into account the system’s application-dependent susceptibility to spoofing attacks and cost of the errors. The convenience of the proposed open-source framework is demonstrated for the face mode, by comparing the security guarantee of four baseline face verification systems before and after they are secured with anti-spoofing algorithms.",

The spoofing databases and the evaluation methodologies for anti-spoofing systems most often comply to the standards for binary classification problems. However the anti-spoofing systems are not destined to work stand-alone, and their main purpose is to protect a verification system from spoofing attacks. In the process of combining the decision of an anti-spoofing and a recognition system, effects on the recognition performance can be expected. Therefore, it is important to analyze the problem of anti-spoofing under the umbrella of biometric recognition systems. This brings certain requirements in the database design, as well as adapted concepts for evaluation of biometric recognition systems under spoofing attacks.",

Face biometrics is natural, intuitive, easy to use, and less human-invasive. Unfortunately, recent work has revealed that face biometrics is vulnerable to spoofing attacks using cheap low-tech equipment. This paper introduces a novel and appealing approach to detect face spoofing using the spatiotemporal (dynamic texture) extensions of the highly popular local binary pattern operator. The key idea of the approach is to learn and detect the structure and the dynamics of the facial micro-textures that characterise real faces but not fake ones. We evaluated the approach with two publicly available databases (Replay-Attack Database and CASIA Face Anti-Spoofing Database). The results show that our approach performs better than state-of-the-art techniques following the provided evaluation protocols of each database.",

With the advent of social media and globalized search, our face images and videos are wide-spread on the internet and can be potentially used to attack biometric systems without previous user consent. Yet, research to counter these threats is just on its infancy - we lack public standard databases, protocols to measure spoofing vulnerability and baseline methods to detect these attacks. The contributions of this work to the area are three-fold: firstly we introduce a publicly available PHOTO-ATTACK database with associated protocols to measure the effectiveness of counter-measures. Based on the data available, we conduct a study on current state-of-the-art spoofing detection algorithms based on motion analysis, showing they fail under the light of these new dataset. By last, we propose a new technique of counter-measure solely based on foreground/background motion correlation using Optical Flow that outperforms all other algorithms achieving nearly perfect scoring with an equal-error rate of 1.52\% on the available test data. The source code leading to the reported results is made available for the replicability of findings in this article.",

Up to date, academic research considers spoofing as a binary classification problem: systems are trained to discriminate between real accesses and attacks. However, spoofing counter-measures are not designated to operate stand-alone, but as a part of a recognition system they will protect. In this paper, we study techniques for decisionlevel and score-level fusion to integrate a recognition and anti-spoofing systems, using an open-source framework that handles the ternary classification problem (clients, impostors and attacks) transparently. By doing so, we are able to report the impact of different spoofing counter-measures, fusion techniques and thresholding on the overall performance of the final recognition system. For a specific use case covering face verification, experiments show to what extent simple fusion improves the trustworthiness of the system when exposed to spoofing attacks.",

The number of countermeasures is gradually increasing and fairly good results have been reported on the publicly available databases. There exists no superior anti-spoofing technique due to the varying nature of attack scenarios and acquisition conditions. Therefore, it is important to find out complementary countermeasures and study how they should be combined in order to construct an easily extensible anti-spoofing framework. In this paper, we address this issue by studying fusion of motion and texture based countermeasures under several types of scenic face attacks. We provide an intuitive way to explore the fusion potential of different visual cues and show that the performance of the individual methods can be vastly improved by performing fusion at score level. The Half-Total Error Rate (HTER) of the best individual countermeasure was decreased from 11.2\% to 5.1\% on the Replay Attack Database. More importantly, we question the idea of using complex classification schemes in individual countermeasures, since nearly same fusion performance is obtained by replacing them with a simple linear one. In this manner, the computational efficiency and also probably the generalization ability of the resulting anti-spoofing framework are increased.",

When spoofed, a biometric recognition system is bypassed by presenting a copy of the biometric evidence of a valid user. Among all biometric modalities, spoofing a face recognition system is particularly easy to perform: all that is needed is a simple photograph of the user. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting face spoofing attacks. In particular, we inspect the potential of texture features based on Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and their variations on three types of attacks: printed photographs, and photos and videos displayed on electronic screens of different sizes. For this purpose, we introduce REPLAY-ATTACK, a novel publicly available face spoofing database which contains all the mentioned types of attacks. We conclude that LBP, with ~15\% Half Total Error Rate, show moderate discriminability when confronted with a wide set of attack types.",

We attribute the reason for this delay, partly, to the unavailability of public databases and protocols to study solutions and compare results. To this purpose we introduce the publicly available PRINT-ATTACK database and exemplify how to use its companion protocol with a motion-based algorithm that detects correlations between the person\'s head movements and the scene context. The results are to be used as basis for comparison to other counter-measure techniques.

After a first processing level using custom electronics based on FPGAs and ASICs, the trigger selection is made by software running on two processor farms, containing a total of around two thousand multi-core machines. This system is known as the High Level Trigger (HLT). To reduce the network data traffic and the processing time to manageable levels, the HLT uses seeded, step-wise reconstruction, aiming at the earliest possible rejection of background events. The recent LHC startup and short single-beam run provided a \'stress test\' of the system and some initial calibration data.

The ATLAS trigger consists of hardware based Level-1, and a two-level software based High-Level Trigger (HLT). Data bandwidth and processing times in the higher level triggers are reduced by region of interest guidance in the HLT reconstruction steps. High flexibility is critical in order to adapt to the changing luminosity, backgrounds and physics goals. It is achieved by the use of inclusive trigger menus and modular software design. Selection algorithms have been developed which provide the required elasticity to detect different physics signatures and to control the trigger rates.

Event selection is conducted in two steps after the hardware-based Level-1 Trigger: a Level-2 Trigger processes detector data based on regions of interest (RoI) and an Event Filter operates on the full event data assembled by the Event Building system. The detector readout is fully commissioned and can be operated at its full design capacity. This places on the High-Level Triggers system the responsibility to maximize the quality of data that will finally reach the offline reconstruction farms. This paper brings an overview of the current ATLAS DAQ/HLT implementation and performance based on studies originated from its operation with simulated, cosmic particles and first-beam data. Its built-in event processing parallelism is discussed for both HLT levels as well as an outlook of options to improve it.",

The calibration stream will be transferred to the Tier-0 facilities that will provide the prompt reconstruction of this stream with a minimum latency of 8 hours, producing calibration constants of sufficient quality to allow a first-pass processing. The Inner Detector community is developing and testing an independent common calibration stream selected at the Event Filter after track reconstruction. It is composed of raw data, in byte-stream format, contained in Readout Buffers (ROBs) with hit information of the selected tracks, and it will be used to derive and update a set of calibration and alignment constants. This option was selected because it makes use of the Byte Stream Converter infrastructure and possibly gives better bandwidth usage and storage optimization. Processing is done using specialized algorithms running in the Athena framework in dedicated Tier-0 resources, and the alignment constants will be stored and distributed using the COOL conditions database infrastructure. This work is addressing in particular the alignment requirements, the needs for track and hit selection, and the performance issues.",

The next two trigger levels run in software on commercial PC farms. They reduce the output rate to 100-200 Hz. In preparation for collision data-taking which is scheduled to commence in May 2008, several cosmic-ray commissioning runs have been performed. Among the first sub-detectors available for commissioning runs are parts of the barrel muon detector including the RPC detectors that are used in the first-level trigger. Data have been taken with a full slice of the muon trigger and readout chain, from the detectors in one sector of the RPC system, to the second-level trigger algorithms and the data-acquisition system. The system is being prepared to include the inner-tracking detector in the readout and second-level trigger. We will present the status and results of these cosmic-ray based commissioning activities.

In this work, we address the electron/jet discrimination at the second-level trigger by building a set of concentric ring sums around the energy deposition peak in each calorimeter segment. An Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on these ring sums is then performed to extract the main sources of the calorimeter signal. The extracted independent components feed the input nodes of a neural electron/jet discriminator. The proposed system is able to achieve higher detection efficiency than the current electron/jet discriminating system operating in ATLAS, while being fast enough to cope with the time restrictions of the ATLAS triggering system operation.",

The interplay between the control and monitoring software with the event readout, event building and the trigger software has been exercised the first time as an integrated system on this large scale. New was also to run algorithms in the online environment for the trigger selection and in the event filter processing tasks on a larger scale. A mechanism has been developed to package the offline software together with the DAQ/HLT software and to distribute it via peer-to-peer software efficiently to this large pc cluster. The findings obtained during the tests lead to many immediate improvements in the software. Trend analysis allowed identifying critical areas. Running an online system on a cluster of 700 nodes successfully was found to be especially sensitive to the reliability of the farm as well as the DAQ/HLT system itself and the future development will concentrate on fault tolerance and stability.",

Este tipo de pré-processamento dos dados permite eficiente compactação dos sinais e alcança elevada capacidade de identificar elétrons. Atualmente, esse sistema vem sendo portado para o ambiente de emulação do sistema de filtragem ATHENA, de modo a se obter uma avaliação realística de seu desempenho. O ambiente tem o objetivo de simular o comportamento do sistema de filtragem, ajudando, desta forma, no desenvolvimento e validação dos algoritmos.

The performance of this implementation has been evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations in terms of the efficiency for the signal channels, rate expected for the selection, data preparation times, and algorithm execution times. Besides the efficiency and rate estimates, some physics examples will be discussed, showing that the triggers are well adapted for the physics programme envisaged at LHC.

This paper describes the design of the ATLAS EF system, its deployment in the 2004 ATLAS combined test beam together with some examples of integrating selection and monitoring algorithms. Since the processing algorithms are not specially designed for EF but are inherited as much as possible from the off-line ones, special emphasis is reserved to system reliability and data security, in particular for the case of failures in the processing algorithms. Another key design element has been system modularity and scalability.

The Level-1, implemented with custom hardware, identifies physics objects within Regions of Interests and operates a first reduction of the event rate to 75 KHz. The higher trigger levels provide a software based event selection which further reduces the event rate to about 100 Hz. This paper presents the algorithm (muFast) employed at Level-2 to confirm the muon candidates flagged by the Level-1. muFast identifies hits of muon tracks inside the Muon Spectrometer and provides a precise measurement of the muon momentum at the production vertex. The algorithm must process the Level-1 muon output rate (~20 KHz), thus a particular care has been used for its optimization. The result is a very fast track reconstruction algorithm with good physics performances which, in some cases, approach those of the offline reconstruction: it computes the pT of prompt muons with a resolution of 5.5\% at 6 GeV and 4.0\% at 20 GeV and with an efficiency of about 95\%.

In a large experiment, like ATLAS, the online data acquisition system is distributed across the nodes of large farms, each of them running several processes that analyse a fraction of the events. In this architecture, it is necessary to have a central process that collects all the monitoring data from the different nodes, produces full statistics histograms and analyses them. In this paper we present the design of such a system, called the gatherer. It allows to collect any monitoring object, such as histograms, from the farm nodes, from any process in the DAQ, trigger and reconstruction chain. It also adds up the statistics, if required, and processes user defined algorithms in order to analyse the monitoring data. The results are sent to a centralized display, that shows the information online, and to the archiving system, triggering alarms in case of problems. The innovation of this system is that conceptually it abstracts several underlying communication protocols, being able to talk with different processes using different protocols at the same time and, therefore, providing maximum flexibility. The software is easily adaptable to any trigger-DAQ system. The first prototype of the gathering system has been implemented for ATLAS and has been running during this year\'s combined test beam. An evaluation of this first prototype will also be presented.",

The ATLAS Second Level Trigger is original in several ways. It makes use of information provided by the First Level Trigger which identifies Regions of Interest (RoI) indicating where the most significant activity has occurred within the detector. Accessing detector data in RoIs only reduces the estimated 100 Gbytes/s data rate by a factor 100. Appart from a custom interface to acquire the RoI information, the Second Level Trigger is implemented in software. Another cost saving approach is the development of Trigger Selection software in an offline environment using a common framework for the High Level Trigger and Reconstruction Software. Consequently, the Second Level Trigger draws on software developed in two largely independant domains: real time oriented dataflow software combined with offline selection software. In this paper we report on experience gained and results obtained with second generation prototype software of both domains. Test of the performance of the data collection have been carried out on testbeds consisting of PCs running Linux and interconnected by Gbit Ethernet switches. The selection software has been tested using simulated detector data preloaded in detector readout buffers.",

To realize a homogeneous software environment for offline components in the High Level Trigger, the Level-2 Steering Controller was developed.

The configuration of each step defines sequences of algorithms which should be used to process the data, and \'trigger menus\' that define which physics signatures must be satisfied to continue on to the next step, and ultimately to accept the event. A navigation system has been built on top of the standard Athena transient store (StoreGate) to link the event data together in a tree-like structure. This is fundamental to the seeding mechanism, by which data from one step is presented to the next. The design makes it straightforward to utilize existing off-line reconstruction data classes and algorithms when they are suitable",

Um dos canais de deteção mais importantes no experimento é o de elétrons com alta energia transversa, representando de 30 a 40\% do total das assinaturas a serem analisadas pelo Sistema de Filtragem. Jatos (de partículas) confundem-se comumente com elétrons pela forma que interagem com os calorímetros. Neste trabalho, apresentamos um sistema de discriminação elétron-jato baseado em redes neurais especialistas, utilizando os dados dos calorímetros do ATLAS. Este sistema, depois de treinado, compacta o espaço de variáveis de entrada (células dos calorímetros) em um subespaço que mantém os aspectos necessários para uma deteção eficiente de elétrons. Os resultados apresentados se mostram melhores que os resultados obtidos usando-se técnicas desenvolvidas no CERN, com o mesmo objetivo.",

The classifier is fed by the information from one of the ATLAS detectors, the calorimeter, a highly segmented detector which measures the energy of particles with high resolution. The information is preprocessed in a clever way, by building concentric energy ring sums, which reduces significantly the input dimensionality. Despite the high information compactation rate, the designed system achieves a very high discrimination efficiency (97\% for electrons and 95,1\% for jets), outperforming the classical solution implemented nowadays at the second level trigger. A system implementation on a fast digital signal processor (DSP) is presented, and its performance is evaluated in both speed and accuracy.",

  abstract   = "Na busca de novos canais físicos em experimentos com partículas colididas, sistemas de validação têm se mostrado de grande valia. Normalmente os subprodutos de colisões interparticulares representam física ordinária e conhecida enquanto que nova física aparece camuflada neste meio. A impossibilidade de gravação e análise do imenso volume de dados produzido nestes ambientes exige o uso de sistemas de validação para que se maximize o espaço de gravação e se minimize o espaço de procura de novos fenômenos.

Em particular, no CERN, o par acelerador/colisionador do LHC, que estará operacional no ano de 2005, utilizará um destes sistemas de validação baseado em 3 níveis em cascata de complexidade crescente e velocidade decrescente. Este sistema tem por objetivo a análise e filtragem, em tempo real, de um volume de dados cuja taxa chega à impressionante faixa de 100.000.000 por segundo.

A divisão do sistema em 3 etapas distintas visa produzir um sistema de validação o mais eficiente e dinâmico possível, sem que se sobrecarregue nenhuma das partes. Para o primeiro nível estima-se a utilização de processadores velozes, com nível baixo de programação, capazes de suportar a taxa inicial dos eventos. Para o terceiro nível o uso de pesado ambiente computacional é previsto.

No segundo nível ambientes altamente programáveis serão combinados com técnicas de paralelização de aplicações para que atinjamos a taxa de processamento requerida de 100.000 eventos por segundo.

Vários tipos de tecnologia estão sendo testadas em todo o mundo para que se decida, não somente sobre a arquitetura, mas, também, sobre o tipo de equipamento a ser empregado neste extenso sistema de classificação.

Este trabalho é sobre a implementação em uma máquina com processamento distribuído de uma das arquiteturas previstas para o segundo nível de validação (ou classificação) do experimento ATLAS/LHC. A  máquina em questão é um sistema Telmat TN310 com processamento distribuído por 16 nós padrão HTRAM totalmente conectados através de uma rede de chaves assíncronas. A arquitetura mencionada prevê a utilização de técnicas de paralelismo de dados e fluxo na obtenção de menores tempos de processamento.

O objetivo final é entender se o processamento em sistemas semelhantes a uma TN310 (visamos o tipo de nó-de-processamento e o padrão de conexão entre estes) pode ser viável para o segundo nível de validação. Isto se dará através da análise e capacidade de abstração proporcionadas pelo desenvolvimento da aplicação sugerida no equipamento.

Soma-se ao trabalho o desenvolvimento de uma unidade de decisões globais baseado em redes neurais. A unidade constitui processo central do sistema de validação. Resultados atingidos são expostos e discussões sobre técnicas de implementação são realizadas no decorrer da documentação.",
