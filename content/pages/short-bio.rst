:summary: Short biography, for all purposes

André Anjos received his Ph.D. degree in signal processing from the `Federal
University of Rio de Janeiro`_ in 2006. He joined the `ATLAS Experiment`_ at
European Centre for Particle Physics (CERN_, Switzerland) from 2001 until 2010
where he worked in the development and deployment of the Trigger and Data
Acquisition systems that are nowadays powering the discovery of the Higgs
boson. During his time at CERN_, André studied the application of neural
networks and statistical methods for particle recognition at the trigger level
and developed several software components still in use today. In 2010, André
joined the `Biometrics Security and Privacy Group`_ at the `Idiap Research
Institute` where he worked mostly with face and vein biometrics, and
presentation attack detection. Since 2018 André heads the `Biosignal Processing
Group`_ at Idiap_. His current interests include reproducible research and
open-science for biomedical and biometrics applications, privacy and security,
and the analysis of medical records through pattern recognition, image
processing and machine learning. Among André's open-source contributions, one
can cite Bob_ and the the BEAT_ web platform for evaluation and testing. He
teaches graduate-level `machine learning courses`_ at the École Polytechnique
Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL_) and serves as reviewer for various scientific
journals in pattern recognition, image processing and biometrics.


Shorter Version
===============

*(if you must)*

André Anjos received his Ph.D. degree in signal processing in 2006 studying the
application of neural nets and statistical methods for particle recognition in
the context of High-Energy Physics experiments at Large Hadron Collider at
CERN_, Switzerland. He joined the `Idiap Research Institute`_ in 2010 where he
works with biosignal processing and biometrics applications. He currently heads
the `Biosignal Processing Group`_ at Idiap_. Current interests include medical
applications, reproducible research, pattern recognition, image processing and
machine learning. André teaches graduate-level `machine learning courses`_ at
the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL_) and serves as reviewer for
various scientific journals in pattern recognition, image processing and
biometrics.
